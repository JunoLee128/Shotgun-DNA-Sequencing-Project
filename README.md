# Shotgun DNA Sequencing Project

This repository contains code to analyze shotgun sequencing samples of DNA (https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Shotgun-Sequencing).
Samples are batch-downloaded from public databases, and then processed using EZBiome's database of core gene species. The resulting species frequencies are analyzed using K-Nearest Neighbors.
